# Resume-Matching-with-Job-Descriptions


Initially created extract.py script to extract details from resumes.
Tried various libraries like PyPDF, pdfq, PDFminer.
PDFminer served best results for me.

jobs.py extracts job descriptions from jacob-hugging-face/job-descriptions dataset.

I tried to combine both these scripts for matching the resumes against the descriptions, but the results are unsatisfactory.

Manually using the extract.py script and jobs.py script to match the jobs is more accurate.
